## 📣 Please, go through these steps before you submit a PR.

1. Make sure that your PR is not a duplicate.
2. If not, then make sure that:

   a. You have done your changes in a separate branch. Branches MUST have descriptive names that start with either the `fix/` or `feature/` prefixes. Good examples are: `fix/signin-issue` or `feature/issue-templates`.

   b. The commit message follows RS School guidelines. You have a descriptive commit message with a short title (first line). Your commit messages are detailed.

   c. You have only one commit (if not, squash them into one commit).

   d. `npm test` doesn't throw any error. If it does, fix them first and amend your commit (`git commit --amend`).

3. **After** these steps, you're ready to open a pull request.

   a. Your pull request MUST NOT target the `main` branch on this repository. You probably want to target `develop` instead.

   b. Give a descriptive title to your PR.

   c. Provide a description of your changes.

   d. Put `closes #XXXX` in your comment to auto-close the issue that your PR fixes (if such).

## ❓ Any questions should be directed to @{user}.
